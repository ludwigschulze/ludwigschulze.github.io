I am a doctoral student at the **European University Institute** in Florence. This Fall Term I am visiting the London School of Economics (LSE). My work focuses on the political effects of communism and how it shaped attitudes towards authoritarianism, identities and political conflicts. I am deploying various research designs and causal inference methods. 


**Working Papers**  

1. Goodbye Comrades! Economic Origins of Communist Legacies

2. Going Through The Roof: Difference-in-Differences Designs in Contexts of Natural Boundaries (with Joris Frese)


**Work in Progress**

1. Winning Transformations (with Hans Lueders)

2. Economic Risk and the Heating Transition: The Electoral Politics of Asset Bans (with Martin Alberdi)
